# Gallows


The gallows game is based on several dozen slogans. Once the user guesses the letter, it appears in a specially designated field, bringing the user closer to guessing the password. However when he selects the wrong letter, a gallows is drawn. There're two ways to end the game, defeat or win and after each ending you can play again.
